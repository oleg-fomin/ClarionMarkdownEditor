Summary
-------
This PR adds the ability to open the Markdown Editor as a document view in the
main area (like source code files) instead of only as a dockable side pad.

Files Changed
-------------
1. ClarionMarkdownEditor.addin
   - Renames existing menu item to "Markdown Editor (Pad)"
   - Adds new menu item "Markdown Editor (Window)"

2. ClarionMarkdownEditor.csproj
   - Includes new source files in compilation

3. MarkdownEditorViewContent.cs (NEW - 137 lines)
   - ViewContent class inheriting from AbstractViewContent
   - Allows editor to be displayed in the main document area
   - Implements Control, IsDirty, FileName properties
   - Implements Load, Save, Dispose, RedrawContent methods

4. ShowMarkdownEditorWindowCommand.cs (NEW - 58 lines)
   - Command to show editor as a main window
   - Uses reflection to call ShowView method for IDE compatibility
   - Includes fallback approach via ViewContentCollection
   - Proper error handling with user feedback

Code Quality Assessment
-----------------------
POSITIVES:
+ Well-documented with XML comments
+ Follows existing patterns (mirrors MarkdownEditorPad and ShowMarkdownEditorCommand)
+ Proper error handling with try-catch and user feedback
+ Uses reflection for SharpDevelop API compatibility (consistent with existing code)
+ RefreshContent() method called by RedrawContent() exists in MarkdownEditorControl

MINOR NOTES:
- Save() and Load() methods only update properties, not actual file content
  (acceptable since MarkdownEditorControl handles file I/O internally)
- Small whitespace changes in csproj (removed trailing blank lines)
- RedrawContent() calls RefreshContent() which reloads file from disk,
  slightly different from existing pad which calls Refresh()

Security Review
---------------
No security concerns identified. The code does not:
- Execute arbitrary commands
- Access network resources
- Handle sensitive data unsafely
- Introduce injection vulnerabilities

Verdict
-------
APPROVED - This PR is safe to accept. The code is well-structured, follows
existing patterns, and adds a useful feature giving users two options for
how to use the editor (dockable pad vs main document window).
